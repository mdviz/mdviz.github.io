# available_counties.csv Read Me File

The avilable_counties.csv holds information on the counties that we have generated data for. If a new county is being added to the website you need to add some basic infomation in this file.

Format should be as so:
```
057,Nevada,sacramento.html
039,Madera,sacramento.html
055,Napa,sacramento.html
081,San Mateo,sacramento.html
```

Where the first item is the `countyfp` (census code number), the second is the name as it should be displayed and the third is the link to the html page that will be displayed.
